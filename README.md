Post-Install-Script

This is a script I made back when I was using Ubuntu,
to make it easier to re-install and get almost the same system I had before.

The Script currently has support for Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ElementaryOS and Arch Linux.

Support for Manjaro Linux got taken out, because I have made my own spin of Manjaro, with my applications pre-installed.
